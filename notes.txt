Tracker Bot

Logs discord text channels to a database.

On ready it should verify the existence of a database for the output and create it if it doesn't exist.
Then it should log messages up until the present message.
Then every X minutes it should update the database with any new messages.

New table for reactions. Primary key = Message.id

The data I'm interested in:
* Graph of amount of messages for each day
* Amount of messages per hour, on average; breakdown by month, or something similar
* Intervals between messages in channels (don't forget that mesasges from different channels should not count), per hours of day. Again, can be on average, per month, etc.
* Average length of message. Would nice to see if there's some corelation to the intervals between messages.
* All of the above, but per user
Can you do on averrage? Per hour in day on average In UTC timezone
